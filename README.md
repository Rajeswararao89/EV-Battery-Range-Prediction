# 🔋 EV Battery Health & Range Prediction Dashboard

A machine learning-powered web application that predicts **battery health** and **EV range** from vehicle sensor data using real-time analytics and visualizations. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn — inspired by real-world use cases like battery optimization in electric fleets.

🌐 **Live Demo**: [Click to Launch App]((https://ev-battery-range-prediction-project-aatrazjoaco6ukkratkigl.streamlit.app/))
📊 **Try it now**: Upload `ev_sensor_data.csv` to get instant predictions.

## 🚗 Project Overview

At scale, electric vehicles (EVs) generate **millions of sensor data points**. This project simulates such telemetry, applies machine learning models, and visualizes:

- ✅ Predicted **Battery Health** (based on voltage, current, temperature, etc.)
- ✅ Predicted **Driving Range**
- 📈 Feature correlation heatmaps
- 📊 Interactive charts (State of Charge, etc.)
