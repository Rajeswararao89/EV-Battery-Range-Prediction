## 🚗 Project Overview

At scale, electric vehicles (EVs) generate **millions of sensor data points**. This project simulates such telemetry, applies machine learning models, and visualizes:

- ✅ Predicted **Battery Health** (based on voltage, current, temperature, etc.)
- ✅ Predicted **Driving Range**
- 📈 Feature correlation heatmaps
- 📊 Interactive charts (State of Charge, etc.)
